Flower Empower

Our client

Flower Empower,  is a Santa Barbara-based volunteer-run charity. 
They collect the donated  flowers from local growers and turn them into bouquets. 
Then delivering these bouquets to sick and elderly over a decade.
Every Saturday, around 30 volunteers gather to assist  either bouquet makers or drivers.
The bouquet makers arrange the donated flowers into beautiful bouquets 
and the drivers pick and deliver them to respective recipients.


The problem

* Manual administrative workload
* Volunteer sing up for events on excel file
* Organizer send email manually to each of them
* Manually calculate delivery routes for drivers to follow
* Information is dispersed across a complex system of Excel sheets, Google Maps, and Gmail
* This arrangement slows the preparation of the events and there is also the risk of forgetting to confirm with a volunteer


The solution

* All tasks centalized in one platform
* Volunteers subscribe to create an account and can sign up for events through our web application
* On Fridays, with just a few clicks, emails with essential information are sent to each volunteer
* Optimized delivery routes to minimize travel time, distance, and the number of stops
* When volunteers check-in, their time is logged into the database (calcuate most engaged volunteer)
